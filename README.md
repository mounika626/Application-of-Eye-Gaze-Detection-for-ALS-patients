<p><b>    Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), which is also called “Lou Gehrig’s Disease,” is a neurodegenerative disease that attacks nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. These motor neurons basically control the muscles throughout the body, and their progressive degeneration eventually leads to the death of ALS patients. In the first stages of ALS, patients begin to lose control of their muscle movements as their motor neurons die. In later stages of the disease, voluntary muscle action is affected, and patients may become totally paralyzed. Patients may experience slurred speech, which can become more severe with time, or even completely lose the ability to speak (dysarthria). ALS is a devastating disease that robs patients of their ability to experience life to the fullest.</b></p>

<p><b>	  Since there is no technology which can heal the neurons, we can develop some applications for helping these patients to have a better life. So, we have done a small application for these patients. This application works based on the detection of the eye gaze of the patient.</b></p>
