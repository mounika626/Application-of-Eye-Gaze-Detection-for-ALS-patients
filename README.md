<h1 align="center"><b>Application of Eye Gaze Detection for ALS patients</b></h1>
<h3><b>Description</b></h3>
<p><b>    Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), which is also called “Lou Gehrig’s Disease,” is a neurodegenerative disease that attacks nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. These motor neurons basically control the muscles throughout the body, and their progressive degeneration eventually leads to the death of ALS patients. In the first stages of ALS, patients begin to lose control of their muscle movements as their motor neurons die. In later stages of the disease, voluntary muscle action is affected, and patients may become totally paralyzed. Patients may experience slurred speech, which can become more severe with time, or even completely lose the ability to speak (dysarthria). ALS is a devastating disease that robs patients of their ability to experience life to the fullest.</b></p>

<p><b>	  Since there is no technology which can heal the neurons, we can develop some applications for helping these patients to have a better life. So, we have done a small application for these patients. This application works based on the detection of the eye gaze of the patient.</b></p>

<h3><b>Tools/Software used :</b></h3>
<ul>
  <li>JupyterLab</li>
  <li>Anaconda</li>
</ul>
                   
<h3><b>Modules used :</b></h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>OpenCV : </b>The main package we have used is opencv. OpenCV-Python is a library of Python bindings designed to solve computer vision problems. OpenCV-Python makes use of Numpy, which is a highly optimized library for numerical operations with a MATLAB-style syntax. All the OpenCV array structures are converted to and from Numpy arrays. This also makes it easier to integrate with other libraries that use Numpy such as SciPy and Matplotlib.</li>
  <li><b>dlib :</b>Another important package used is dlib. Dlib is a toolkit for making real world machine learning and data analysis applications in C++. While the library is originally written in C++, it has good, easy to use Python bindings.</li>
  <li><b>numpy :</b> NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays. It also has functions for working in the domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.</li>
  <li><b>math :</b> The math module is a standard module in Python to use mathematical functions.</li>
  <li><b>pyglet :</b> pyglet is a cross-platform windowing and multimedia library for Python, intended for developing games and other visually rich applications.</li>
  <li><b>mutagen :</b> Mutagen is a Python module to handle audio metadata.</li>
  <li><b>win32com :</b> It is an API which is used to convert text to speech. </li>
  <li><b>ffpyplayer :</b> FFPyPlayer is a python binding for the FFmpeg library for playing and writing media files.</li>
  <li><b>glob :</b> The glob module finds all the pathnames matching a specified pattern according to the rules used by the Unix shell, although results are returned in arbitrary order.</li>
  <li><b>time :</b> This module provides various time-related functions.</li>
</ul>

<h3><b>Steps to execute :</b></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Install all the required packages present in requirements.txt.</li>
  <li>Place all the packages in the same repository as your code.</li>
  <li>Adjust the coordinates of eye according to your eyes.</li>
  <li>Execute the code</li>
</ul>

<h3><b>Conclusion</b></h3>
<p>Eye tracking is an important technique that offers an objective way to see where in a scene a person’s visual attention is located. Today, the human eye-gaze can be recorded by relatively unremarkable techniques. This project argues that it is possible to use eye-gaze of a computer user in the interface to aid the control of the application. Care must be taken, though, that eye-gaze tracking data is used in a sensible way, since the nature of human eye-movements is a combination of several voluntary and involuntary cognitive processes. There are some patients whose motor nerves do not work properly. So, this project helps in improving quality of living for ALS patients by helping them to tell their needs or entertain themselves using eye gaze. </p>
